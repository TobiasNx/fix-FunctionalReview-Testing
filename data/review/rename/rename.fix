# This might be okay, but some things to consider:

# This only works on fields in an objects, not deeper nested structures.
rename("others", "ani", "QR")

# This seems not to work. Perhapse it is an array of objects.
rename("animals[]", "ani", "XY")

# Also you cannot rename all fields in root.
# rename(".", "ani", "XY")
