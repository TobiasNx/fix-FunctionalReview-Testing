rename("others", "ani", "QR")

rename("animals[]", "ani", "XY")

# This seems not to work. Perhapse it is an array of objects.
# I do not know which function of the following should work.
# rename("animals[].*", "ani", "XY")

# Honestly I do not know if renaming the whole subhirachy should be an default option.
# This could/should be an option. Or the process should go with the `each`-Bind.
